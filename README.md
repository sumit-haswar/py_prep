Reference materials used:
1. Stanford CS Education Library (http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/)
2. Elements of Programming Interviews in Python
3. Cracking the Coding Interview
4. The Algorithm Design Manual
5. Introductions to Algorithm
6. Leetcode

#### Stage I:
Start by reading the following 3 absolute basic material provided at the http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/
1. Linked List Basics 
2. Linked List Problems
3. Binary Trees
4. The Great Tree List Recursion Problem (optional)

For people with Computer Science background or even a few years of programming experience this 
should be a good refresher. Its just to get your hands a little dirty, to get re-introduces . 
Also for the go-getters I highly also recommend no. 4, as stated on the web-page it is one of the neatest 
pointer/recursion problems you will ever see. It is an advanced problem that uses linked lists, 
binary trees, and recursion.

It is a basic online library which collects education CS material from Stanford courses and 
distributes them for free.

#### Stage II:
Now its time to turn it up a notch. This stage is to cover the basic building data structures
in computer science starting with bits, ints, strings till stacks and queues. 
We further extend on linked-list with a further deep-dive on the problems beyond the basics. 
- Primitive Types
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked List
- Stacks and Queues

#### Stage III:
- Binary Trees
- Heaps
- Sorting
- Searching
- Hash Tables
- Binary Search Trees
- N-ary Trees

#### Stage IV:
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
