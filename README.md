#### Stage I:
Start by reading the following 1-4 fundamental Computer Science materials provided at http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/. 
It is a basic online library which lists a few undergrad level CS material from Stanford.
1. Linked List Basics 
2. Linked List Problems
3. Binary Trees
4. The Great Tree List Recursion Problem (optional)
5. Big O Notations (ref-material no. 3 or 5)

For people with Computer Science background or even a few years of programming experience this 
should be a good refresher. Its just to get your hands a little dirty, to get re-introduced... 
Also for the go-getters I highly recommend no. 5, as stated on the web-page it is one of the neatest 
pointer/recursion problems you will ever see. It is an advanced problem that uses linked lists, 
binary trees, and recursion.

#### Stage II:
Now its time to turn it up a notch. This stage is to cover the basic data structures
in computer science starting from bits, ints, strings to stacks and queues. 
We further extend on linked-list with a deep-dive on looking at problems beyond the basics 
from the previous section. 
- Primitive Types
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked List
- Stacks and Queues

#### Stage III:
- Binary Trees
- Heaps
- Sorting
- Searching
- Hash Tables
- Binary Search Trees
- N-ary Trees
- System Design

#### Stage IV:
- Graphs
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming

---------------------

#### Functional Programming
It is a style of programming which avoids side-effect, uses immutable data-structures and performs 
code execution using function evaluation.
Using this style, one can reduce the likelihood of bugs, make code much more readable and also make sure 
your programs are easier to maintain.

#### Research Papers
This is something of a personal list, and may/may-not help. Nonetheless
